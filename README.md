# QuantumTrojanDetector
A quantum-based Trojan detection system using Grover’s algorithm.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains a custom implementation of Grover’s Algorithm designed specifically for detecting hardware Trojans in digital circuits. Instead of using built-in quantum libraries for Grover’s algorithm, we developed our own quantum logic to simulate the process from scratch.

*NOTE*
=> You must install Qiskit to run the quantum circuit simulations in this project.
